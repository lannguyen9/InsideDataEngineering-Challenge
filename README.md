# Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
Entry for Lan Nguyen

I employed Python scripts for this challenge based on my knowledge of R Suite. The run.sh script creates the required outputs as well as produces a visual of the Twitter Hashtag graph in the images folder. The Python script average_degree.py will continue to scan the input file for changes for one minute before closing. Due to time constraints (and unfamiliarity with Python), the tweets_cleaned.py script unfortunately produces an output with unnecessary whitespace. As difficult as this challenge was to do, it was quite rewarding to accomplish the goals to the best of my ability. Thank you for your consideration to this amazing opportunity!
