# Insight Data Engineering - Coding Challenge
Entry for Lan Nguyen

I employed Python scripts for this challenge based on my knowledge of R Suite. The run.sh script creates the required outputs as well as produces a visual of the Twitter Hashtag graph in the images folder. The Python script average_degree.py will continue to scan the input file for changes for one minute before closing. Due to time constraints (and unfamiliarity with Python), the tweets_cleaned.py script unfortunately produces an output with unnecessary whitespace. As difficult as this challenge was for myself, it was very rewarding to accomplish the goals. Thank you again for your consideration to this amazing opportunity!
